# ESP8266 Programming

In this chapter we will have a look at the building blocks of an Arduino sketch. This will help you to understand and modify
the WeatherStation which we will build in the next chapter. If you just want to get the WeatherStation running you can skip this
chapter.

## Preparation

In this chapter we will work with exercises which you can download from GitHub. They contain several Arduino projects for the
ESP8266. For an exercise open the related project in your Arduino IDE and try to solve the given task. If you get stuck or want
to see an alternative solution open the project which ends with "_Solution":

 * Exercise_04_01: contains the first exercise in chapter 4
 * Exercise_04_01_Solution: contains a possible solution

Now download the zip file from GitHub and extract it in a place you will find it later. There is a green "Clone or download"
button which lets you download a zip file:

## The Arduino Sketch

The Arduino platform was built with the beginner in mind. Compared to a normal C program the Arduino IDE hides a few things
from you to simplify the setup. First of all you do not have to create a make file to build your code into an executable binary.
The Arduino IDE also includes a default header file for you: #include "Arduino.h". This contains all definitions needed for a
regular Arduino program.

Another important change compared to a regular C/C++ program are the two default functions setup() and loop(). The first
will be only called once during startup while the loop() method will be called repeatedly. On a normal Arduino hardware
(Atmega chip) you can theoretically write code and never leave the loop() method again. The ESP8266 is a bit different here.
If your operations run for too much time a so called *watchdog* will reset the ESP8266. You can prevent this by allowing the
controller to do important operations while you are still in the main loop. Calling *yield()* or *delay(ms)* will do this.

## Hello World: The serial console

Every self respecting programming tutorial starts with a "Hello World" program. And I don't want to break with this tradition
here. A Hello-World program usually does not more than printing these two words somewhere on the screen. But we are programming
a micro controller which does not have a screen yet. So where can we display the text? We will use the Serial object to do that.
While you are developing a program on the ESP8266 the micro controller is connected to the computer the Arduino IDE is running
on. We use this connection to write a new binary onto the flash memory of the ESP8266. And while our program is running we can
also use it to write messages from the ESP8266 back to our computer.

Using the Serial object is fairly easy. You have to initialize it first:

    Serial.begin(115200);

This tells the Serial object that you want to communicate with a baud rate of `115200`. Remember to set the same transfer rate
later in the serial console on your computer. Both partners in the communication need to have the same speed settings or you will
just see garbage. If you want to send a message from your program to your computer you just this:

    Serial.print("Hello ");
    Serial.println("World");

Please have a look at a little difference between the first and the second line. The first uses a method called `print` and
the second `println`. The only difference is that the later is adding a line break to the output.

The exercise contains another important built-in function:

    delay(1000);

This instructs the processor to wait 1000 milliseconds or 1 second to continue with the execution. As mentioned earlier
with this command you also give the processor time to handle other tasks, such as receiving or sending network packages
over WiFi. In this context a call to `yield()` does the same as `delay(0)`.


## Input/ Output: GPIO pins

Now that we can talk to our micro processor over the serial line it is time to interact with the real world. Our ESP8266
is equipped with several so called `General Purpose Input Output` or short GPIO pins. They can be used for many different
applications sensing and generating digital signals of the 3.3 Volt range. This is important if you plan to use an external
component with your ESP8266: hardware designed for older Arduino's is often using the 5V (CMOS) range. Using such a device without
a logic level shifter might destroy your ESP8266.

Using a GPIO pin is quite easy: first you tell the micro processor if you want to read or write from the pin. Then you do it.
Here is the code for reading:

      pinMode(PIN, INPUT);
      int state = digitalRead(PIN);

Unless you want to change the mode of a pin you only need to call pinMode() once. Please note that depending on the pin
you can also use INPUT_PULLUP or INPUT_PULLDOWN. Writing to a pin is not much different:

      pinMode(PIN, OUTPUT);
      digitalWrite(PIN, HIGH); // or
      digitalWrite(PIN, LOW);

The second statement will show a `HIGH` level on `PIN` which will be 3.3V. The third statement will set the pin to
`LOW` which is 0V. What values for `PIN`can you use? If you are using a generic ESP8266 module your pins will be labeled
`GPIO0`, `GPIO1`, etc. To use pin GPIO you would write `digitalWrite(0, HIGH);`

If you are using a NodeMCU things get a little bit more complicated. The original creators of the NodeMCU Lua firmware and
the development module of the same name had the idea to give the pins different names. They are called `D0`, `D1`, etc.
That by itself would not be confusing yet but they are not using the same digits, e.g. `GPIO1` is not equal to `D1`. Here
is a table to map the pins:

| Raw Module Name | NodeMCU & Wemos Name |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| GPIO0           | D3                   |
| GPIO1           | D10                  |
| GPIO2           | D4                   |
| GPIO3           | D9                   |
| GPIO4           | D2                   |
| GPIO5           | D1                   |
| GPIO6           | N/A                  |
| GPIO7           | N/A                  |
| GPIO8           | N/A                  |
| GPIO9           | D11                  |
| GPIO10          | D12                  |
| GPIO11          | N/A                  |
| GPIO12          | D6                   |
| GPIO13          | D7                   |
| GPIO14          | D5                   |
| GPIO15          | D8                   |
| GPIO16          | D0                   |
