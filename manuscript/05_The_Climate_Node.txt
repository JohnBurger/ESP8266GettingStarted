# Collecting and Displaying Local Data

So far we have created a device which is connect to the internet and uses an API to fetch weather data. But this is not really an Internet-of-Things application, after all we are just displaying data. In this chapter we will change that.

##Â The Climate Node

This project will enable you to collect humidity and temperature in one room of your house or apartment and display the values in another room on the WeatherStation. In order to do so you will need additional hardware which is not included in the basic WeatherStation Starter Kit:

* An additional ESP8266 module, ideally a NodeMCU
* a DHT11 or DHT22 humidity and temperature breakout module

I will call this combo "The Climate Node". Now use the female-female jumpers to connect them like this:
